Displays your archives as a compact list of years that expands when clicked.

== Description ==

The Flexo Archives Widget displays your archives as a list of years that expands when clicked (thanks to some JavaScript magic) to show the months with posts. You also have the option of displaying the number of posts in each month.

This widget is designed to be a more compact alternative to the default archives widget supplied with WordPress 2.2.X.

NOTE: Due to a silly mistake on my part, versions of the Flexo Archives Widget prior to version 1.0.3 don't actually work because the link to the JavaScript source was incorrect. I urge anyone who downloaded older versions to give the widget a try with the latest code.

== Installation ==

This plugin is a sidebar widget.  You will need to have WordPress 2.2 or the [Automattic Widgets Plugin](http://automattic.com/code/widgets/ "Widgets Plugin at automattic.com").

1. Expand `flexo-archives-widget.VERSION.zip`
1. Upload the whole `flexo-archives-widget` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the Flexo Archives Widget plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. To add the widget to your sidebar, go to Presentation -> Widgets in WordPress.
1. Configure the widget's title and whether post counts are displayed.
